# softmax-function
Softmax function was developed to to take care of issues raised with sigmoid function such as what happens when we have more than 2 variables, how do we get the probability of what an outcome is given a set of all possible outcome, etc. Here I developed a simple function that takes a set of values and return their softmax function equivalent. There are many ways to approach this using Python however I will be using a simple algorithm :) 
Updating with a simpler function using Pytorch
